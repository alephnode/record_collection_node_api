# Record Collection RESTful API Using Node and Express

This api is to establish the ground work for my eventual record collection website. I'm using Node and Express to build it out.

To test out application, clone the project and navigate to http://localhost/8888 (Assuming you have the dependencies installed and your mongoDB instance started).
